We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no!
We don't talk about Bruno... but
It was my wedding day
It was our wedding day
We were getting ready, and there wasn't a cloud in the sky
No clouds allowed in the sky
Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin-
Thunder!
You telling this story, or am I?
I'm sorry, mi vida, go on
Bruno says, "It looks like rain"
Why did he tell us?
In doing so, he floods my brain
Abuela, get the umbrellas
Married in a hurricane
What a joyous day... but anyway
We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no!
We don't talk about Bruno!
Hey! Grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling
Siempre podía escucharlo murmurar y murmurar
Lo asocio con el sonido de la arena al caer, ch-ch-ch
Es un trabajo pesado, con un regalo tan humilde
Siempre dejaba a Abuela y a la familia buscando a tientas
Grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand
Do you understand?
A seven-foot frame
Rats along his back
When he calls your name
It all fades to black
Yeah, he sees your dreams
And feasts on your screams (hey!)
We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no! (We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no!)
We don't talk about Bruno (we don't talk about Bruno!)
He told me my fish would die
The next day: dead! (No, no!)
He told me I'd grow a gut!
And just like he said... (no, no!)
He said that all my hair would disappear, now look at my head (no, no! Hey!)
Your fate is sealed when your prophecy is read!
Me dijo que la vida de mis sueños estaría prometida, y algún día sería mía
Me dijo que mi poder crecería, como las uvas que prosperan en la vid
Óye, Mariano está en camino
Me dijo que el hombre de mis sueños estaría fuera de mi alcance
Betrothed to another
It's like I hear him now
Hey sis', I want not a sound out of you (it's like I can hear him now)
I can hear him now
Um, Bruno...
Yeah, about that Bruno...
I really need to know about Bruno...
Gimmie the truth and the whole truth, Bruno
(Isabella, your boyfriend's here)
Time for dinner!
A seven-foot frame (it was my wedding day, it was our wedding day)
Rats along his back (we were getting ready)
When he calls your name (and there wasn't a cloud in the sky)
It all fades to black (no clouds allowed in the sky!)
Yeah, he sees your dreams (Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin-)
And feasts on your screams (thunder!)
¿Estás contando esta historia, o soy yo?
Lo siento, mi vida, sigue (óye, Mariano está en camino)
Bruno dice: "Parece lluvia" (un marco de siete pies, ratas a lo largo de su espalda)
Al hacerlo, inunda mi cerebro.
Married in a hurricane
He's here!
Don't talk about Bruno, no! (Why did I talk about Bruno?)
Not a word about Bruno!
I never should've brought up Bruno!
